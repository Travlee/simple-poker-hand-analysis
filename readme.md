Write a simple app that can take two 5-card poker hands, classify each hand, and determine which hand would win. For this problem suits are ignored, so a flush will not be possible.

Each card can be represented by a single character:
    A for ace
    K for king
    Q for queen
    J for jack
    T for ten
    2-9 for the remaining
    * for a wild card (max of 1 per hand)

Hand classifications are as follows (highest to lowest):
    four-of-a-kind (4 cards of the same value: AAAA5)
    full house (3 of one, and 2 of another: KKKQQ)
    straight (all 5 in sequential order: 6789T)
    three-of-a-kind (3 cards of the same value: KKK23)
    two pair (AA33J)
    pair (44KQA)
    high card (nothing else: A267J)

Comparison rules:
    When comparing two pair hands, compare the highest pair first, then the next pair. i.e. AA223 > KKQQT, since AA > KK. When the highest pair is a tie, move on to the next pair. i.e. AA993 > AA88K.
    Similarly, when comparing full house hands, the three-card group is compared first. AAA22 > KKKQQ.
    In the case of ties, determine a winner by comparing the next highest card in the hand. i.e. AA234 < AA235 because AAs tie, 2s tie, 3s tie, but 4 < 5.
    Straights are compared by the highest card in the hand, except for A2345, in which case the 5 is considered the highest card in the straight.

Wild cards:
    When there is a wild card, the final hand has to be a valid 5-card poker hand (no five-of-a-kind!)

For each comparison, display the classification, as well as indicate which hand would win (or that it's a tie). For example:
    AAAKT vs 22233: AAAKT three-of-a-kind < 22233 full house
    2345* vs KKJJ2: 2345* straight > KKJJ2 two pair
    AAKKT vs AAKKT: AAKKT two pair == AAKKT two pair
    KKKKA vs KKKK*: KKKKA four-of-a-kind == KKKK* four-of-a-kind

Bonus points for including some unit tests! Don't worry about the visuals. Plain text inputs are totally fine. We're just looking for clean code.
